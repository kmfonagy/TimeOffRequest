Project: Time Off Request
	
The Time Off Request app allows users to be able to submit time off requests to their supervisor through a web interface. A supervisor can see the time off request and either approve or deny the request. The app will eliminate the need to use any type of paperwork or other approaches that seem slow, bulky, or just outdated.
